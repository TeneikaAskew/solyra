# Agent instructions

**Last reviewed:** unknown · **Last scanned:** 2026-09-28 · **Owner:** TBD

## Delivery gate
Read `.claude/skills/product-delivery/SKILL.md` and follow it for any code change. The same gate
(`scripts/gate/spec_gate.py`) runs on every commit and every PR regardless of which agent authored it.
A branch that changes code must carry the FEAT-ID: `feature/<feat-id>-<slug>` or `fix/<feat-id>-<slug>`.
The only other shapes are `docs/<slug>` (documentation only), `chore/<slug>` (dependency fields of manifests,
lockfiles and the gate's own files), `spike/<slug>` (local commits, never a PR) and `bot/superpowers-*`
(the vendored skills), as Phase 0 of the product-delivery skill sets out.

## Review guidelines

For every reviewer of a pull request in this repository: Codex, which reads this section; Claude,
which CLAUDE.md Rule 2.5 sends here; and a person. stocks and solyra carry the same guidelines.

### The first review is the complete one

A reviewer's first review of a pull request is the complete one. A pull request gets at most two
review rounds (CLAUDE.md, "Review cap"), an approved spec does not change in place, and Codex's code
review runs again when new commits are pushed to a pull request open for review, so a finding held
back costs a round, and on a spec PR a whole re-cut PR. Before it posts:

- It reads every changed file in full, generated files included, and the direct callers and callees
  of what changed, and where a changed file's generator runs in the reviewer's environment it re-runs
  it and compares.
- It posts, against the revision it reviews, every finding it can raise on a defect the pull request
  introduces or makes worse, at every severity, with one finding per defect class listing each
  location. When a finding is one instance of a class, it searches for every instance before it
  posts the class.
- It checks the edges a change creates (errors and rejections, late or out-of-order responses,
  signed-out and other-account states, empty and null data, and the docs, tests and generated files
  that cite what changed). Empty and null data are judged by this repository's no-silent-fallbacks
  rule, CLAUDE.md Rule 4.
- A spec PR is reviewed against the code it will change: the reviewer opens each file the spec names
  and checks that every `done_when` item can be met, and each `done_when` item that describes
  behavior must fail against a broken implementation. Items that record delivery (the gate, the docs
  audit, the catalog row) are only checked for being met.

### Later reviews

A later review by the same reviewer checks its earlier findings, then the new commits, and still
posts a defect it finds in what its first review covered, for the author to classify under CLAUDE.md
Rule 2.5.

### Problems this pull request did not cause

A problem the pull request neither introduces nor makes worse is not posted as a finding (a reviewer
who can open an issue may open one), since every thread holds the merge (REQ-GOV-001).

### Browser proof

A change a user can see in the site carries Playwright evidence from a run that exercises the
changed code: solyra's hermetic suite for a solyra change; for a stocks change, an API test of the
changed response in the PR, while runs against the deployed site before the merge and once staging
has deployed it are close-out steps the owner posts on the PR, not boxes the PR ticks.

- solyra's hermetic suite (`npm run e2e`) intercepts every `/api` call, so it cannot prove a stocks
  change. The API test in the stocks PR is that proof.
- The deployed-site runs are the owner's: staging's trigger deploys from `main`, deploying a stocks
  branch with `platform/deploy.sh` would put unreviewed code behind the live site, and the deployed
  site's sign-in is interactive (`npm run e2e:cloud:auth` runs headed).
- Each run carries screenshots of the state each run shows, which the test saves with
  `page.screenshot` into its output directory under `test-results/` (`testInfo.outputPath(...)`),
  where the e2e workflow's `playwright-report` artifact keeps them 7 days. The test takes them itself
  because `npm run e2e` runs with Playwright's screenshot option off; solyra's e2e workflow uploads
  `test-results/` in that artifact.
- The screenshots are described state by state in a PR comment and kept in the e2e run's
  `playwright-report` artifact (saved under `test-results/`, kept 7 days) or sent to the owner, since
  images cannot be attached to a PR from a Claude Code session.

The reviewer asks for the hermetic run or the API test when the PR lacks it.
